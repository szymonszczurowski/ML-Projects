**This project presents a series of predictive models** developed and tested using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set**. The primary application of these models is the **classification of breast cancer tumors** into **benign or malignant** categories based on extracted features from cell nuclei in digital images of breast mass biopsies.

## Comparison model
Several machine learning models have been employed and evaluated to determine their effectiveness in predicting the malignancy of breast tumors. The models tested include, but are not limited to:

- **SGDClassifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier**
- **Gaussian Process Classifier**
- **MLPClassifier**
  
A comparative analysis has been conducted to assess the **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC** among other metrics for each of the models.
The model results are **summarized in graphs** to make it easier to understand how each model performs.
